  <h2>7 Common Mistakes Customers Make During Appliance Breakdowns</h2>
  <p>When appliances fail, homeowners often panic or make rushed decisions that can lead to costly consequences. At <strong>Subzero &amp; Viking Repair Brooklyn</strong>, we educate our customers so they can avoid these common pitfalls:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Delaying the Repair:</strong> Waiting too long to fix minor issues (like strange noises or leaks) can lead to major damage that’s more expensive to fix.</li>

    <li><strong>2. DIY Fixes Without Experience:</strong> YouTube tutorials aren’t a substitute for certified repair. DIY can make the problem worse and void your warranty.</li>

    <li><strong>3. Choosing the Cheapest Service:</strong> Going for the lowest quote often results in poor service or reused parts. Instead, choose an <strong>affordable appliance repair service</strong> that’s trusted and transparent.</li>

    <li><strong>4. Ignoring Brand Expertise:</strong> Hiring generalists instead of specialists in <strong>Viking appliance repair</strong> or <strong>Subzero repair services</strong> can lead to improper diagnosis and poor workmanship.</li>

    <li><strong>5. Not Asking About Parts:</strong> Using non-OEM parts might save a few bucks but can reduce efficiency and reliability. We only use genuine Subzero & Viking parts.</li>

    <li><strong>6. No Warranty Check:</strong> Customers often pay out-of-pocket without checking if the appliance is still under warranty or if the repair company offers any.</li>

    <li><strong>7. Not Getting a Detailed Invoice:</strong> A professional technician should provide a clear invoice, showing parts used and work done — for your records and warranty claims.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By avoiding these mistakes and trusting <strong>professional appliance technicians near me</strong> like those at Subzero &amp; Viking Repair Brooklyn, you save time, money, and stress.</p>
